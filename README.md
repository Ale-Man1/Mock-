# Mock-Youtube-Page

Project created while learning how to use HTML and CSS.
Project has the header, and sidebar to imitate the previous youtubes design (UI changed while I was creating the project), the main area on the page has six actual thumbnails of videos that grow or shrink depending on the size of the browser window.
